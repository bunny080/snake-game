Guide the green block with care — your mission is to reach the red block without touching the walls. Once you make contact, the green block will transform into a sleek, slithering snake, growing longer with each move. But beware: one wrong move into the wall, and it’s game over! Stay sharp, move smart, and let the snake dance begin!
